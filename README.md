## Introduction
Welcome to my awesome data science project portfolio. In my repo, you can find awesome and practical solutions to some of the real world business problems with statistical methods and the-state-of-art machine learning models. Most of my projects will be demoed in jupyter notebook. Jupyter notebook is an excellent way to share my work with the world. It comes with markdown and interactive python environment and it is portable to other platforms like Databricks and Google Colaboratory as well.

My project collection covers various trending machine learning applications such as *Natural Language Processing*, *Large Scale Machine Learning with Spark*, and *Recommender System*. There are more to come. Potential future projects include *Text Summarization*, *Stock Price Forecast*, *Trading Strategy with Reinforcement Learning*, and *Computer Vision*.

## Customer Churn Study

Churn rate is one of the important business metrics. A company can compare its churn and growth rates to determine if there was overall growth or loss. When the churn rate is higher than the growth rate, the company has experienced a loss in its customer base.

Why customers churn and stop using a company's services? What is the estimate amount of churn for next quarter? Being able to answer above two questions can provide meaningful insights about what direction the company is currently heading towards and how the company can improve its products and services so that constomers would stay.
