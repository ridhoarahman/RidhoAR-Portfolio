## Introduction

Welcome to my data science project portfolio. In my repo, you can find practical solutions to some of the real world business problems with statistical methods and machine learning models. My projects will be demoed in jupyter notebook. Jupyter notebook is an excellent way to share my work with the world. It comes with markdown and interactive python environment and it is portable to other platform like Google Colaboratory.

## CustomerChurnStudy

Churn analysis is an evaluation of customer loss or displacement, so that it can be considered to reduce it.

This is also referred to as customer attrition rate, churn can be minimized by assessing your product and how people use it

High churn rates force businesses to contend with the pressures and difficulties of bringing in enough new customers. Even at a small level, a one-point increase in the churn rate (%) can quickly have a large negative effect on a company's ability to grow.
